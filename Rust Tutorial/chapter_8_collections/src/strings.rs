// Strings are stored as collection of UTF-8 encoded bytes
// "strings" are implemented as a "collection of bytes", plus some methods to provide useful functionality when those bytes are interpreted as text.

// Rust has only one string type in the core language, which is the string slice str that is usually seen in its borrowed form &str. string slices, which are references to some UTF-8 encoded string data stored elsewhere. String literals, for example, are stored in the programâ€™s binary and are therefore string slices.
