// If you donâ€™t provide an else expression and the condition is false, the program will just skip the if block and move on to the next bit of code.

// Using too many else if expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more than one, you might want to refactor your code. Chapter 6 describes a powerful Rust branching construct called match for these cases.

// You can place the "break" keyword within the loop to tell the program when to stop executing the loop
// We also used "continue" in the guessing game, which in a loop tells the program to skip over any remaining code in this iteration of the loop and go to the next iteration.

// One of the uses of a loop is to retry an operation you know might fail, such as checking whether a thread has completed its job. You might also need to "pass the result" of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code. To do this, you can add the "value you want returned after the break expression" you use to stop the loop; that value will be returned out of the loop so you can use it
