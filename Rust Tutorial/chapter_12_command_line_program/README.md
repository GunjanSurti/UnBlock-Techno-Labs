# Developing the Library’s Functionality with Test-Driven Development

=> Test-Driven Development (TDD) process with the following steps:

1. Write a test that fails and run it to make sure it fails for the reason you expect.
2. Write or modify just enough code to make the new test pass.
3. Refactor the code you just added or changed and make sure the tests continue to pass.
4. Repeat from step 1!

Though it’s just one of many ways to write software, TDD can help drive code design. Writing the test before you write the code that makes the test pass helps to maintain high test coverage throughout the process.

there are two kinds of output: standard output (stdout) for general information and standard error (stderr) for error message

we’ll run the program with > and the file path, output.txt, that we want to redirect the standard output stream to
